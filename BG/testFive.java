/*
Answer & Explanation:

The given Java code will result in a compilation error.

Reason:

1. Java does not allow throwing primitive types (like int) as exceptions. Only objects that inherit from Throwable (like Exception or Error) can be thrown.


2. The catch block must handle an exception object, but here it attempts to catch an int, which is invalid syntax.*/
